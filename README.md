# Let's ask the user to try using 'print' themselves.
print("\nNow it's your turn! Try to use the 'print' function to output your own message.")
user_input = input("Enter a message: ")

# We'll output whatever the user entered.
print("\nHere's what you entered:")

# Finally, let's explain that 'print' can be used with variables as well.
print("\nGreat job! Did you know that the 'print' function can also be used to output variables? Let's try it out.")
